DOSBox-X Manual (always use the latest version from www.dosbox-x.com)

DOSBox-X is a fork of the original DOSBox project (www.dosbox.com)




I am rewriting this README, and new information will be added over time --J.C.



Open source development
-----------------------

Ideas and patches are always welcome, though not necessarily accepted.

If you really need that feature or change, and your changes are not
accepted into this main project (or you just want to mess around with
the code), feel free to fork this project and make your changes in
your fork.

As joncampbell123 only has limited time to work on DOSBox-X, help is
greatly appreciated:

  - Testing
    - Features
    - Hardware accuracy
    - Software accuracy
    - Games, applications, demoscene executables
    - Windows 1.x through Millenium guest OS support
    - Retro development
  - Bug fixes, patches, improvements, refinements
  - Suggestions, ideas, general conversation
  - Platform support (primarily Linux and Windows, but others are welcome)
  - Documentation
  - Notes regarding games, applications, hacks, weird MS-DOS tricks, etc.

If you want to tweak or write some code and you don't know what to work
on, feel free to visit the issue tracker to get some ideas.
